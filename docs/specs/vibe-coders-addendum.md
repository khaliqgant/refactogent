# Refactoring Agent — Addendum for "Vibe‑Coded" Repos (v1.0)

This addendum tailors the base spec to messy, fast‑hacked, under‑tested repos—typical of solo founders and small teams.

**Audience:** Users who shipped an MVP quickly and now have drifted code style, light/no tests, and fragile structure.  
**Prime directive:** Stabilize behavior first, then refactor in tiny, reviewable steps—without breaking anything.
