# Project Stabilization Report

## Project Analysis
- **Path**: /Users/khaliqgant/Projects/refactogent/refactoagent-starter/cli
- **Type**: mixed
- **Languages**: typescript, javascript
- **Has Tests**: No
- **Has Config**: No

## Stabilization Plan
- **HTTP Routes to Characterize**: 5
- **CLI Commands to Characterize**: 2
- **Safety Gates Enabled**: Yes

## Next Steps
1. Review the generated test plan in `test-plan.json`
2. Run characterization tests to establish baseline behavior
3. Verify all safety gates are configured correctly
4. Proceed with refactoring operations

## Safety Considerations
- Characterization tests will capture current behavior
- No code changes will be made during stabilization
- All tests must pass before refactoring begins
- Coverage baseline will be established
