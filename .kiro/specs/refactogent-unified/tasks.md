# Refactogent Unified Implementation - Implementation Plan

## Competitive Advantage: Why RefactoGent > Cursor/Claude

**The key differentiator**: RefactoGent provides **markedly better refactoring quality** than Cursor or Claude by leveraging:

1. **Deterministic Pre-Analysis**: Unlike Cursor/Claude that work with raw code, RefactoGent pre-processes code through AST analysis, dependency mapping, and safety scoring
2. **Structured Context**: RCP (Refactor Context Package) provides curated, relevant context vs. Cursor's raw file dumps
3. **Multi-Pass Validation**: LLM output goes through deterministic validators, test execution, and self-critique
4. **Project-Specific Guardrails**: Enforces project rules, naming conventions, and architectural patterns
5. **Behavior Preservation**: Characterization tests ensure refactoring doesn't break existing functionality
6. **Safety-First Approach**: Every change validated through build, test, and semantic equivalence checks

**Result**: RefactoGent delivers production-ready, safe refactors that Cursor/Claude cannot match.
