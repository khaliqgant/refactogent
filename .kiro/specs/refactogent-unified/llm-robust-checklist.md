## 🏗️ Implementation Notes
- **Language support order**: TS/JS → Python → Go → Java → Ruby
- **Model policy**: prefer latest GPT-class for planning; smaller local/hosted models for rerankers and linters
- **Storage**: start with Postgres + pgvector; abstract behind DAO to swap later
- **Testing**: heavy use of containerized fixtures; snapshot-based diff checks

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations
- **Index drift** → aggressive incremental indexing; repo-state hash in cache keys; periodic full reindex
- **Prompt bloat** → strict token budgeter; rerankers; hierarchical summaries
- **Hallucination** → grounding checks; reject generations referencing non-existent symbols
- **Cost creep** → batch rerank, cache hits, distillation for common tasks
- **Slow CI** → selective test running from code graph; flaky test quarantine

---

## 📋 Final Deliverable Checklist
- [ ] Ingestor + multi-index + incremental updates
- [ ] Code graph with APIs and tests mapping
- [ ] Retrieval orchestrator + packer with audits
- [ ] Planner + tool exec with rollback
- [ ] Safety gate v1 with PR annotations
- [ ] UX surfaces (IDE + CLI) with context preview
- [ ] Eval harness + RefactoBench + dashboards
- [ ] Policy & privacy controls
