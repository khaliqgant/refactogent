# RefactoAgent Unified Implementation - Requirements Document

## Introduction

RefactoAgent is a comprehensive refactoring assistant that provides safe, incremental, and reviewable code refactoring capabilities. The system prioritizes behavior preservation through characterization tests, semantic equivalence checks, and strict validation gates. It supports both local-first development workflows and GitHub App integration, with special consideration for "vibe-coded" repositories that may have technical debt or limited test coverage.

The implementation will be phased in 10 steps, starting with robust local testing capabilities to ensure the system works reliably across different project types before expanding to full GitHub integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Local Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test RefactoAgent locally on different project types so that I can validate its behavior before deploying it to production repositories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the local test suite THEN the system SHALL execute refactoring operations on sample projects of different types (TypeScript, Python, Go)
2. WHEN I provide a test project THEN the system SHALL analyze the project structure and generate a safety assessment report
3. WHEN I run characterization tests THEN the system SHALL capture current behavior through golden tests for HTTP routes, CLI commands, and library functions
4. IF a test project has insufficient test coverage THEN the system SHALL generate baseline tests before attempting any refactoring
5. WHEN I execute a refactoring operation locally THEN the system SHALL validate all changes through build, test, and semantic equivalence checks

### Requirement 2: Core Refactoring Engine

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reliable refactoring engine that can perform safe code transformations so that I can improve code quality without introducing bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request a refactoring operation THEN the system SHALL use AST-based transformations to ensure syntactic correctness
2. WHEN performing symbol renaming THEN the system SHALL update all references across the codebase using static analysis
3. WHEN extracting functions THEN the system SHALL preserve behavior and update all call sites
4. IF a refactoring would change public API surfaces THEN the system SHALL reject the operation unless explicitly allowed
5. WHEN applying transformations THEN the system SHALL generate unified diffs with clear before/after comparisons

### Requirement 3: Safety and Validation System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive safety checks so that refactoring operations never break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any refactoring is proposed THEN the system SHALL run characterization tests to establish baseline behavior
2. WHEN changes are applied THEN the system SHALL execute full build and test suites to verify correctness
3. WHEN semantic equivalence checks are available THEN the system SHALL compare API responses and CLI outputs with tolerance for non-semantic differences
4. IF any validation step fails THEN the system SHALL abort the operation and provide detailed failure information
5. WHEN coverage analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL ensure no decrease in line or branch coverage

### Requirement 4: Multi-Language Support

**User Story:** As a developer working with polyglot codebases, I want RefactoAgent to support multiple programming languages so that I can refactor my entire project consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing TypeScript projects THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript Server and ts-morph for AST operations
2. WHEN analyzing Python projects THEN the system SHALL use LibCST and Ruff for parsing and linting
3. WHEN analyzing Go projects THEN the system SHALL use go/ast and standard Go tooling
4. WHEN detecting project type THEN the system SHALL automatically configure appropriate toolchains and build commands
5. WHEN language-specific patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate refactoring strategies

### Requirement 5: Policy and Configuration Engine

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want to configure refactoring policies so that the system respects project-specific constraints and safety requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a `.refactor-agent.yaml` file is present THEN the system SHALL load and enforce all specified policies
2. WHEN protected paths are defined THEN the system SHALL prevent modifications to those directories
3. WHEN refactoring modes are restricted THEN the system SHALL only allow approved operation types
4. IF policy violations are detected THEN the system SHALL block the operation and explain the violation
5. WHEN coverage thresholds are set THEN the system SHALL enforce minimum coverage requirements

### Requirement 6: CLI and IDE Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want convenient access to RefactoAgent through command-line and IDE interfaces so that I can integrate it into my existing workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run CLI commands THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and progress indicators
2. WHEN using VS Code extension THEN the system SHALL integrate with the editor's command palette and provide contextual actions
3. WHEN running in LSP mode THEN the system SHALL provide JSON-RPC interface for IDE integration
4. IF operations are long-running THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates and cancellation options
5. WHEN generating outputs THEN the system SHALL write results to predictable locations with clear naming

### Requirement 7: GitHub Integration

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want RefactoAgent to work with GitHub repositories so that refactoring can be part of our collaborative development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configured as a GitHub App THEN the system SHALL authenticate with minimal required permissions
2. WHEN creating refactoring PRs THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive safety information and artifacts
3. WHEN webhook events are received THEN the system SHALL process them according to configured triggers
4. IF PR checks fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure information and suggested remediation
5. WHEN auto-merge is enabled THEN the system SHALL only merge after all safety gates pass

### Requirement 8: Observability and Debugging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring so that I can troubleshoot issues and track system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log structured data with trace IDs
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture context and provide actionable error messages
3. WHEN artifacts are generated THEN the system SHALL store them with clear metadata and retention policies
4. IF performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide timing information for each operation phase
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL support verbose logging modes without exposing secrets

### Requirement 9: Vibe-Coded Repository Support

**User Story:** As a developer with a messy codebase, I want RefactoAgent to work safely with under-tested and inconsistent code so that I can gradually improve code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a vibe-coded repository THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive debt assessment
2. WHEN test coverage is low THEN the system SHALL prioritize test generation before structural changes
3. WHEN public API surfaces are unclear THEN the system SHALL use dynamic analysis to identify them
4. IF characterization tests cannot be established THEN the system SHALL block risky refactoring operations
5. WHEN working incrementally THEN the system SHALL provide small, reviewable changes with clear safety explanations

### Requirement 10: Extensibility and Plugin System

**User Story:** As a developer with specific refactoring needs, I want to extend RefactoAgent with custom transformations so that I can address project-specific patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN custom refactoring patterns are needed THEN the system SHALL support plugin registration
2. WHEN plugins are loaded THEN the system SHALL validate their safety constraints and capabilities
3. WHEN custom transformations are applied THEN the system SHALL enforce the same safety checks as built-in operations
4. IF plugin conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution guidance
5. WHEN plugin APIs change THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility where possible
